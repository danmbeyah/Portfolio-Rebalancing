# Portfolio-Rebalancing
An evidence-based comparison of portfolio rebalancing techniques.

# Background
In their 2015 white paper, "The Best Practices of Portfolio Rebalancing" analysts at Vanguard Research made a strong case that annual/semi-annual monitoring of a portfolio reasonably rebalances all concerns.

This project will assess a hypothetical 50/50 stock/bond portfolio allocation performance from 1926 to 2014 using three rebalancing techniques:

1. Calendar rebalancing
2. Threshold rebalancing
3. Calendar + Threshold rebalancing
