# Portfolio-Rebalancing
An evidence-based comparison of portfolio rebalancing techniques.

# Background
In their 2015 white paper, "The Best Practices of Portfolio Rebalancing" analysts at Vanguard Research made a strong case that annual/semi-annual monitoring of a portfolio reasonably rebalances all concerns.

This project will assess a hypothetical 50/50 stock/bond portfolio allocation performance from 1926 to 2014 using three rebalancing techniques:

1. Calendar rebalancing
2. Threshold rebalancing
3. Calendar + Threshold rebalancing

# Disclosure
This project is intended to be used to teach fundamentals of investment based on David E. Linton's book "Fundamentals of Investment Management" and does not reflect any Investment Manager's strategy.
